## Initial Configuration ##

Before the first start, modify the permissions of the scripts to make them executable:

bash
chmod +x ./sequ_data_framework_Illumina.sh
chmod +x ./sequ_data_framework_ONT.sh


You need to insert the variables directly into the shell scripts (sequ_data_framework_Illumina.sh 
and sequ_data_framework_ONT.sh), you will be assigning your specific file paths to these 
variables. Below is an example of how you might declare these variables in the scripts with 
placeholders for your actual paths:

	# Specify the base path where the data is located
	path_base_data="/path/to/your/base/data"
	
	# Specify the path to the input data
	input_data="/path/to/your/input/data"
	
	# Provide the path to the reference sequence file (.fa-file)
	path_reference_sequence="/path/to/your/reference/sequence.fa"

Replace the placeholder paths (/path/to/your/...) with the actual paths on your system. You would 
insert these variable declarations near the beginning of your sequ_data_framework_Illumina.sh 
and sequ_data_framework_ONT.sh scripts, right after the shebang line (#!/bin/bash) and before 
any commands that use these variables.

Remember: Whenever you modify scripts, it's important to ensure that the paths you insert match 
the actual locations of the files and directories on your file system. Incorrect paths will lead 
to errors when running the scripts.



## Running the Scripts ##

To run the scripts, use the following commands in the terminal:
bash

./sequ_data_framework_Illumina.sh 
./sequ_data_framework_ONT.sh

Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the paths specified in the scripts are correct 
before execution.
